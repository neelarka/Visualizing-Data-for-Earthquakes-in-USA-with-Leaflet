## Visualization of the GeoJSON Earthquake data
- The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats that is updated every 5 minutes. Using the [USGS GeoJSON Feed page](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) we can pick a data set to visualize; the last hour, the past day, the past 7 days and the past 30 days.  

- I used the GeoJSON link for the last 7 days of earthquake data and JavaScript to map the data along with fault lines in [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)
